# CurvilinearAngularSpectrumMethod
Angular Spectrum Method and Fourier Beamforming Technique for Curvilinear Arrays

We previously demonstrated a Fourier beamforming technnique that could be used to reconstruct ultrasound images from any arbitrary sequence of transmissions using the angular spectrum method: https://github.com/rehmanali1994/FourierDomainBeamformer. The main limitation of this and other Fourier beamforming approaches is that they are primarily limited to linear/planar arrays. Here we provide the implementation of the angular spectrum method in a polar coordinate system that enables the application of the Fourier beamforming technique in curvilinear arrays.

We provide sample data and algorithms presented in

for the reconstruction ultrasound images using the Fourier beamforming technique and its time-domain equivalent. If you use the code/algorithm for research, please cite the above paper.

# Code and Sample Datasets
Each image reconstruction algorithm is implemented in both MATLAB and Python:
1) Conventional dynamic-receive beamforming ([FocTxRecon.m](FocTxRecon.m) and [FocTxRecon.py](FocTxRecon.py))
2) Virtual source synthetic aperture ([VirtualSourceRecon.m](VirtualSourceRecon.m) and [VirtualSourceRecon.py](VirtualSourceRecon.py))
3) REFoCUS ([AdjointBasedREFoCUS.m](AdjointBasedREFoCUS.m) and [AdjointBasedREFoCUS.py](AdjointBasedREFoCUS.py))
4) Full-Waveform Reconstruction in Time Domain ([TimeDomFullWaveRecon.m](TimeDomFullWaveRecon.m) and [TimeDomFullWaveRecon.py](TimeDomFullWaveRecon.py)) and Frequency Domain ([FreqDomFullWaveRecon.m](FreqDomFullWaveRecon.m) and [FreqDomFullWaveRecon.py](FreqDomFullWaveRecon.py))

Please see any supporting functions in [beamforming_functions](beamforming_functions).

**Please download the sample data (FocTxDataset.mat) under the [releases](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/FourierDomainBeamformer/releases) tab for this repository, and place that data in the main directory ([FourierDomainBeamformer](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/FourierDomainBeamformer)).**

# Sample Results
We show the following multistatic synthetic aperture image reconstruction using the Fourier beamforming technique with the polar form of the angular spectrum method:

The Fourier beamforming technique provided is equivalent to the time-domain cross-correlation process below:

We also acquired channel data in-vivo using focused transmit beams on a clinical scanner to obtain the following synthetic aperture image reconstruction:

We show the same time-domain cross-correlation process in-vivo as well:
